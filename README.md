# MNIST Classifier - Deep Learning Basics  

This repository provides a beginner-friendly introduction to deep learning concepts. It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.  

## Features  
- Uses the **MNIST dataset** (handwritten digits 0-9).  
- Implements a **fully connected neural network**.  
- Applies **TensorFlow and Keras** for model training.  
- Covers **data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction**.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
